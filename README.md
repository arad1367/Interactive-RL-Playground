## Overview

This repository contains four interactive reinforcement learning simulations designed to visualize core RL algorithms and concepts. Each simulation provides a different environment and learning algorithm, allowing users to understand how agents learn to navigate and make decisions in various scenarios.

The simulations are built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, making them highly accessible across platforms with no dependencies.

## Installation & Usage

These simulations are self-contained HTML files that can be run locally without any build process or dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arad1367/Interactive-RL-Playground.git
cd Interactive-RL-Playground
```

2. Open any of the HTML files in a modern web browser:

```bash
# For example, to open the Q-Learning simulation:
open Q-Learning.html
```

3. Interact with the simulation using the provided controls to adjust parameters and observe the learning process.

## Key RL Concepts

These simulations demonstrate several key reinforcement learning concepts:

- **Q-Learning**: A value-based method that learns the quality of actions in states by updating a Q-table using the Bellman equation.
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Balancing random actions (exploration) with known good actions (exploitation) using an epsilon-greedy policy.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: A policy gradient method that uses a clipped surrogate objective to prevent large policy updates.
- **Reward Functions**: Different simulations use various reward structures to guide agent learning.
- **Learning Parameters**: Adjustable parameters like learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate to control the learning process.
- **Policy and Value Networks**: Represent the agent's strategy (policy) and estimated values of states.

## Future Work
